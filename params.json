It can be required and used in your code but it can also be used as a stand-alone command line tool.\r\nWhen executed from the command line you get some nice output and when executed from within your code you get callbacks with stats.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nwhen used as a lib in your app/build script install it locally  \r\n`npm install hulken --save`\r\n\r\nwhen used as a command line tool  \r\n`npm install hulken -g`\r\n\r\n##Usage (as a library)\r\n\r\nWhen you require hulken in your node application.\r\n```\r\nvar hulken = require('hulken');\r\n\r\nvar hulken_options = {  \r\n  targetUrl: 'http://localhost:8888',  \r\n  requestsFilePath: './path/to/my/app/hulkenRequests.json'\r\n};  \r\n\r\nhulken.run(function(stats){  \r\n  console.log('error ... perhaps i should look closer at the stats');  \r\n  },function(stats){  \r\n  console.log('success! ... auto tweet my stats to the world!');  \r\n},hulken_options);\r\n\r\n```\r\n**targetUrl** and **requestsFilePath** are mandatory, but you can also override the following settings:\r\n\r\n>**setting name** (default value) | explanation  \r\n\r\n* **targetUrl** (\"http://localhost\") | url to application under test  \r\n* **numberOfHulkenAgents** (1) | number of agents sending requests\r\n* **timesToRunEachRequest** (1) | number of times to execute each request per agent  \r\n* **requestsFilePath** (\"./hulkenRequests.json\") | path to requestsFile (including file name)  \r\n* **tokensSkippingRequest** ([':']) | requests with urls containing one or more of these chars gets ignored  \r\n* **requestsToSkip** (['/logout', 'signoff']) | requests with urls matching one of the provided urls gets ignored\r\n* **loginRequired** (false) | is a login required to execute the requests?\r\n* **username** (\"\") | mandatory if loginRequired is true ... the username\r\n* **password** (\"\") | mandatory if loginRequired is true ... the password\r\n* **usernamePostName** (\"username\") | the username post name\r\n* **passwordPostName** (\"password\") | the password post name\r\n* **loginUrl** (\"/login\") | the url to post to when logging in\r\n* **loginResponseExpectedText** (\"\") | a text which hulken searches for in the response to the login post (if non is provided hulken will consider http 200 OK good enough)\r\n* **happyTimeLimit** (10) | max test suite duration (in seconds). If the whole test takes longer than this value hulken gets angry.\r\n* **slowRequestsTimeLimit** (3) | response times (in seconds) over this value are considered slow\r\n* **angryOnFailedRequest** (false) | Hulken gets angry (calls error callback) if a single request fails\r\n* **chatty** (true) | set to false to make Hulken less chatty\r\n* **happyMessage** (\"HULKEN PLEASED WITH RESULT, NO ONE NEEDS TO GET HURT TODAY!\") | pass in what you want Hulken to say when Hulken is happy with a result\r\n* **angryMessage** (\".... BAD RESULT... HULKEN ANGRY!\") | pass in what you want Hulken to say when Hulken is angry with a result\r\n* **minWaitTime** (1000) | minimum wait time in milliseconds (every request waits for a random time before executing)\r\n* **maxWaitTime** (6000) | maximum wait time in milliseconds (every request waits for a random time before executing)\r\n* **returnAllRequests** (false) | If true the stats object will contain all executed requests (stats.allRequests)\r\n* **headers** ({}) | set HTTP headers in a simple object: {'key1', 'value1', 'key2', 'value2'}. These headers will be set for every request in the test.\r\n\r\nThe requestsFile is a json file and looks like this.  \r\n```\r\n[{\r\n“method”:”get”,\r\n“path”:”/index”,\r\n“expectedTextToExist”:”Start”\r\n},\r\n{\r\n“method”:”get”,\r\n“path”:”/about”,\r\n“expectedTextToExist”:”About us”\r\n},\r\n{\r\n“method”: “post”,\r\n“path”: “/”,\r\n“expectedTextToExist”: “thank you for your POST”,\r\n“payload”: {\r\n“foo”: “bar”\r\n}}]\r\n```\r\nPOSTs require a payload.\r\n\r\n**The stats object returned looks like this.**\r\n```\r\n{ numberOfHulkenAgents: 50,\r\n  numberOfConcurrentRequests: 150,\r\n  numberOfUniqueRequests: 3,\r\n  totalSecondsElapsed: 6.001,\r\n  avgReqResponseTime: 0.001806666666666668,\r\n  reqsPerSecond: 24.995834027662056,\r\n  randomRequestWaitTime: '1-6 seconds',\r\n  slowRequests: [],\r\n  failedRequests: [] }\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Usage (as a command line tool)\r\nWhen you use hulken from the command line, you should first install it globally.  \r\n`npm install hulken -g`\r\n\r\nand then you can use the *hulken* command to run a stress test:\r\n```\r\nhulken myCustomOptions.json\r\n```\r\nThe options file is a simple json and looks something like this.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n“targetUrl” : “http://yourapp.com”,\r\n“requestsFilePath”: “../path/to/hulkenRequests.json”\r\n}\r\n```  \r\nHulken can even generate an example options file for you, all you have to do is provide the target url.\r\n```\r\nhulken make_options http://localhost:8080\r\n```\r\n\r\n**You can set the same settings in this options file as when you require hulken in your code and passing in an options object.**  \r\n*See Usage (as a library).* Options files make it easy to reuse your requestsFile against different environments.\r\n\r\n##hulken_informant's\r\nan hulken_informant offers a quick and simple way to create a stress test suite by inspecting your application routes and auto generating the requests file for you!\r\n\r\n[hulken_informant_express3 (works with express3)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/hulken_informant_express3)  \r\n[hulken_informant_hapi (works with hapi.js)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/hulken_informant_hapi)  \r\n**missing your framework?**  \r\nfeel free to create a *hulken_informant_x* and send me the link\r\n\r\n##Blog posts\r\n[The shortest path to stress tests ](http://hellgrenj.tumblr.com/post/96170338318/the-shortest-path-to-stress-tests)  \r\n[Automatically generated stress tests with hulken and hulken informant](http://hellgrenj.tumblr.com/post/90755234673/automatically-generated-stress-tests-with-hulken-and)\r\n\r\n##Release notes\r\n**0.9.0** (non breaking changes only)\r\n* set HTTP headers for every request in the test by passing in the option ```headers : {'key1' : 'value1', 'key2' : 'value2'}```\r\n* minor code refactoring\r\n\r\n**0.8.0** (non breaking changes only)\r\n* pass in option ```returnAllRequests: true``` to include all executed requests (path and response time) in the stats object\r\n\r\n**0.7.4** (non breaking changes only)\r\n* minor fixes\r\n\r\n**0.7.3** (bug fixes)\r\n* fixed a bug that came with the latest refactoring\r\n\r\n**0.7.1** (non breaking changes only)\r\n* code refactoring and minor fixes\r\n\r\n**0.7.0** (non breaking changes only)\r\n* Hulken can now generate an example options file when executed from the command line.\r\n ```hulken make_options http://localhost:8080``` will create\r\nan example options file with http://localhost:8080 as the targetUrl.\r\n\r\n**0.6.1** (minor bug fix)\r\n* stats object returned now containing correct randomRequestWaitTime\r\n\r\n**0.6.0** (non breaking changes only)\r\n* minWaitTime can now be passed in as an option\r\n* maxWaitTime can now be passed in as an option\r\n\r\n**0.5.0** (non breaking changes only)\r\n* pass in \"chatty: false\" to make Hulken less chatty!\r\n* happyMessage can now be passed in as an option\r\n* angryMessage can now be passed in as an option\r\n\r\n##Tests\r\n`npm test`\r\n\r\n##License\r\nReleased under the MIT license.
